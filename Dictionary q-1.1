Lara, a skilled archivist, has two collections of ancient artifacts stored in separate dictionaries. 
Each dictionary contains artifact names as keys and their respective ages in years as values. 
Lara wants to merge these two dictionaries into a single dictionary to create a unified record of all the artifacts.
Write a Python program that takes two dictionaries as input from Lara and merges them into one. 
The program should then print the merged dictionary.

Input Format
Two dictionaries representing Lara's artifact collections. Each dictionary has artifact names as keys and their respective ages as values.

Output Format
A single dictionary that merges the two input dictionaries and Print the merged dictionary.

Sample Input:
Ten:10, Twenty:20
Thirty:30, Forty:40

Note: Separate each pair by comma and a space 

Sample Output:
{'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30, 'Forty': 40}

Solutioin:

dic_1=input()
dic_2=input()
dict_1=dict(i.split(":") for i in dic_1.split(","))
dict_2=dict(i.split(":") for i in dic_2.split(","))
dict_1={key : int(value) for key,value in dict_1.items()}
dict_2={key : int(value) for key,value in dict_2.items()}
merged_dict={**dict_1,**dict_2}
print(merged_dict)
