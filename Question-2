Input
Line 1: Two Integers V denoting his initial balance, and N denoting the amount of transactions he will make.
Next N lines: One String Transaction denoting if he's depositing (D) or withdrawing (W), along with an integer Amount denoting the amount he is handling in the transaction.

Transaction = "W"||"D"

Input

70

Solution:

v, n = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
for i in range(n):
    inputs = input().split()
    tr = inputs[0]
    amount = int(inputs[1])
    if(tr=="W"):
        v=v-amount
    elif (tr=="D"):
        v=v+amount
print(v)
