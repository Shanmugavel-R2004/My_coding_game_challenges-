You are given a list of positive integers. Your task is to compute the sum of the squared differences between each consecutive pair of integers in the list.

Input
Line 1: An integer 𝑁, representing the number of integers in the list.
Line 2: 𝑁 positive integers separated by spaces. Each integer 𝑎 represents an element in the list.

Output
A single line containing the sum of the squared differences between each consecutive pair of integers in the list.

Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4

Solution:

n = int(input())
l= list(map(int,input().split()))
print(sum((j-i)**2 for i,j in zip(l[:-1],l[1:])))
