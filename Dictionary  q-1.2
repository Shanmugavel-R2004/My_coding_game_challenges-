Lara, while organizing her digital library, needs to frequently check if certain values exist in her metadata dictionaries. 
Each dictionary contains metadata fields as keys and their respective values.
Write a Python program that takes a dictionary and a value as input from Lara and checks if the given value exists in the dictionary. 
The program should then print whether the value is present in the dictionary.

Input Format
A dictionary representing Lara's metadata collection (keys are metadata fields, values are their respective values).

Output Format
A message indicating whether the value is present in the dictionary or not

Sample Input
aa:100, b:200, c:300
200

Note: Separate each pair by comma and a space

Sample Output:
Present

Solution:

a= input()
b= input()
c= dict(item.split(":") for item in a.split(", "))
value = b.strip()
if value in c.values():
    print("Present")
else:
    print("Not Present")
